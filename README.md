# PwaPodcatcher

This project was created to demonstrate how PWA tech is able to create a new kind of web experience, comparable to native apps. I wrote about it more extensively on [my website](https://zacharysvoboda.com/project/pwa-podcatcher/).

## Development

You need yarn to run this locally.

Run `yarn start` to get the development server running. You can access it at localhost:4200/.
If you need to develop changes to the serverless apis, and run `yarn develop:local-services` and access the site at localhost:3000/

## Production

The master branch is automatically deployed to https://pwa-podcatcher-nine-black.now.sh/ by Zeit.
